<h3>Let's learn the basic library that mostly used in Machine Learning </h3>

### Code Explanation and Use Cases

```python
# Importing all the libraries that we need.
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
```

1. **NumPy (`import numpy as np`):**
   - **Explanation:** NumPy is a library for numerical computations in Python.
   - **Use Cases:** Handling arrays and matrices, performing mathematical operations on large datasets efficiently.

2. **Pandas (`import pandas as pd`):**
   - **Explanation:** Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis.
   - **Use Cases:** Reading data from various file formats (CSV, Excel), data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, working with DataFrames.

3. **Matplotlib (`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`):**
   - **Explanation:** Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
   - **Use Cases:** Generating plots and graphs (line plots, bar charts, histograms), visualizing data trends and distributions.

4. **Seaborn (`import seaborn as sns`):**
   - **Explanation:** Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
   - **Use Cases:** Creating informative and attractive statistical graphics, such as heatmaps, violin plots, and box plots.

5. **Matplotlib Inline Magic (`%matplotlib inline`):**
   - **Explanation:** This is a Jupyter Notebook-specific command that allows Matplotlib plots to be displayed inline within the notebook.
   - **Use Cases:** Ensuring that all plots generated in a Jupyter Notebook are shown immediately below the code cells that produce them.

This set of libraries is essential for performing data analysis, visualization, and manipulation, providing a comprehensive toolkit for handling and exploring datasets in Python.
