ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Mehedi Hasan, and I graduated from Daffodil International University with a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering. I have a genuine passion for data science, machine learning, and AI innovation, which encourages me to dive into the tech world.

My recent research paper received the prestigious "Best Paper Award" at the 2nd International Conference on Cross-Disciplinary Academic Research 2023 [ICAR 2023](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mehedihasan-cse_research-bestpaperaward-icar2023-activity-7115986048735744000-xAzE?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of heart disease data to uncover critical insights. The analysis aimed to answer key questions such as:

How many people have heart disease and how many don't? <br>
Which sex has the most heart disease cases? <br>
The distribution of chest pain types across different sexes. <br>
Identification of chest pain types most prone to heart disease. <br>
Age vs. maximum heart rate in people with heart disease. <br>
Age vs. maximum heart rate in people without heart disease. <br>
Age vs. serum cholesterol levels in people with heart disease. <br>
Age vs. serum cholesterol levels in people without heart disease. <br>
Exercise-induced angina prevalence by sex. <br>
Prevalence of fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl by sex <br> <br>
The dataset included features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar levels, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia status. Sensitive patient information was anonymized to ensure privacy.

<h4> Highlights </h4>
Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis to explore the relationship between different variables and heart disease.
Sex-based Analysis: Determining how sex influences the prevalence of heart disease and associated factors.
Age and Health Metrics Correlation: Insights into how age correlates with maximum heart rate and serum cholesterol levels in both heart disease and non-heart disease populations.
This project enhanced my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis, providing valuable insights into the factors associated with heart disease.
