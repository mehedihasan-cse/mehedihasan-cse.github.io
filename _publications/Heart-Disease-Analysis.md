Heart Disease Analysis 

In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of heart disease data to uncover critical insights. The analysis aimed to answer key questions such as:

How many people have heart disease and how many don't? <br>
Which sex has the most heart disease cases? <br>
The distribution of chest pain types across different sexes. <br>
Identification of chest pain types most prone to heart disease. <br>
Age vs. maximum heart rate in people with heart disease. <br>
Age vs. maximum heart rate in people without heart disease. <br>
Age vs. serum cholesterol levels in people with heart disease. <br>
Age vs. serum cholesterol levels in people without heart disease. <br>
Exercise-induced angina prevalence by sex. <br>
Prevalence of fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl by sex <br> <br>
The dataset included features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar levels, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia status. Sensitive patient information was anonymized to ensure privacy.

<h4> Highlights </h4>
Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis to explore the relationship between different variables and heart disease.
Sex-based Analysis: Determining how sex influences the prevalence of heart disease and associated factors.
Age and Health Metrics Correlation: Insights into how age correlates with maximum heart rate and serum cholesterol levels in both heart disease and non-heart disease populations.
This project enhanced my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis, providing valuable insights into the factors associated with heart disease.
